# Sage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JohnStarich/sage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JohnStarich/sage) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JohnStarich/sage/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/JohnStarich/sage?branch=master)

Be your own accountant, without the stress.

Automatically download transactions from your banks and credit cards, then categorize them based on your own rules.

## Features

* [x] Automatically sync your ledger with banks and credit card institutions
* [x] Uses [double-entry bookkeeping][] to keep things in check
* [x] Can deploy as a single binary or as a Docker container

For future features, [see below](#future-work)

## Install

To install, run `go get github.com/johnstarich/sage`

## Usage

For available options, run `sage -help`

Sage requires a ledger ([plain text accounting][]) file, an `ofxclient.ini` [credentials][ofxclient] file, and an [`hledger` rules][hledger rules] file.

[plain text accounting]: https://plaintextaccounting.org
[ofxclient]: https://github.com/captin411/ofxclient/#bank-information-storage
[hledger rules]: https://hledger.org/csv.html#csv-rules

The ledger will store all of your transactions in plain text so you can easily read it with any text editor. It also supports [several other tools][ledger tools] that can generate reports based on your ledger.

The `ofxclient.ini` file is currently generated by the [ofxclient][] CLI, but only supports passwords in the clear right now. (Plans for encrypted password stores coming in the future.)

The rules file is a format designed by the [hledger][] project for importing CSVs. This file will help Sage automatically categorize incoming transactions into the appropriate accounts for your ledger. After a transaction has been imported, it is assigned an account (category) from this file. To follow convention, only include rules to change the `account2` field or a `comment`. While changing `account1` is supported, it will likely cause problems with Sage since account1 is assumed to be the source institution of the transaction.

## Future work

* [ ] Web UI to view transactions, accounts, and balances
* [ ] Budget tracking (maybe add over-budget notifications)
* [ ] Automatic version control to reduce risk of data loss
* [ ] Smarter categorization by training on current ledger
* [ ] Web UI to add credentials for new accounts
