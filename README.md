## Data storage

Sage uses a ledger ([plain text accounting][]) file, a simple JSON-encoded accounts file, and an [`hledger` rules][hledger rules] file.
**You won't need to know about these files to use Sage.** However, if you're a power-user, then these formats may come in handy.

[hledger rules]: https://hledger.org/csv.html#csv-rules

The ledger will store all of your transactions in plain text so you can easily read it with any text editor. It also supports [several other tools][ledger tools] that can generate reports based on your ledger.

**Warning:** Some banks, like [Bank of America][], may charge a fee for downloading transactions. While this is uncommon, we are not responsible for these charges. Do your homework if you want to be certain these charges won't apply to you.

The rules file is a format designed by the [hledger][] project for importing CSVs. This file will help Sage automatically categorize incoming transactions into the appropriate accounts for your ledger. After a transaction has been imported, it is assigned an account (category) from this file. To follow convention, only include rules to change the `account2` field or a `comment`. While changing `account1` is supported, it will likely cause problems with Sage since account1 is assumed to be the source institution of the transaction.
Currently, the web UI only supports `account2`.

## Future work

* [ ] Budget tracking (maybe add over-budget notifications)
* [ ] Forecasts on current transactions to identify trends
* [ ] Automatic version control to reduce risk of data loss
* [ ] Smarter categorization by training on current ledger

## Awesome libraries üëè

Sage relies on [`aclindsa/ofxgo`](https://github.com/aclindsa/ofxgo) for it's excellent Go implementation of the OFX spec.
